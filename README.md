## Machine Yearnings

You read it correctly. This is not a site about machine learning. This is a site about how machines yearn! You may think that with all of the advances made in machine learning and all the talk around the topic that these machines should be pretty capable of some rudimentary things. But the fact is, machines still yearn to do the most basic things. For example, we’ve yet to create a machine that can cook up more than one recipe! Even with one recipe, machines are horrible at it. If you don’t believe me, check out how stupid they are in this video. Before we get carried away by movies that romanticize how great robots are, let’s take a serious step back and evaluate how incapable we have been at making them.

I decided to obtain my masters of statistics at UNC-Chapel Hill after working for five years in finance and fintech. Along the way, I’ve stumbled upon some great ways to learn statistics and some not so efficient ways to acquire knowledge in this field. I hope to chronicle and share my path.

If you are interested in more of my work, check out my Linkedin, resume or thesis. My thesis uses a cross sectional and longitudinal approach to model the association between exposure to chemicals found in your everyday plastic bottles and stress hormones. Why does this matter? Well, oxidative stress is directly related to giving preterm birth (So if you are a guy, and you’d like to procreate, this still matters).
